In Chapter 15 of One Up on Wall Street, Peter Lynch presents a comprehensive checklist to guide investors in evaluating stocks. This checklist is tailored to different categories of companies, helping investors make informed decisions based on the specific characteristics of each type. Here’s a summary of the key points from his checklist: ￼

📊 General Stock Evaluation

For any stock, consider the following:
	•	Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Assess whether it’s high or low relative to the company’s historical P/E and compared to industry peers.
	•	Institutional Ownership: Lower institutional ownership may indicate undiscovered potential.
	•	Insider Activity: Insider buying and company share buybacks are positive signals.
	•	Earnings Growth: Look for consistent and sustainable earnings growth. ￼ ￼ ￼

⸻

🐢 Slow Growers
	•	Typically large, mature companies with modest growth.
	•	Focus on dividend yield and stability.
	•	Ensure the company isn’t accumulating excessive debt. ￼

⸻

🏰 Stalwarts
	•	Large, established companies with solid financials.
	•	Expect moderate growth (10-12% annually).
	•	Monitor for signs of overexpansion or declining profit margins. ￼ ￼ ￼

⸻

🔄 Cyclicals
	•	Companies whose performance is tied to economic cycles.
	•	Invest during industry downturns and sell during upswings.
	•	Watch for inventory levels and capacity utilization as indicators.

⸻

🚀 Fast Growers
	•	Small, aggressive companies with high growth potential.
	•	Look for companies expanding within a niche market.

	•	Identify catalysts for recovery, such as new management or product lines.
	•	Ensure the company has sufficient cash flow to sustain operations during the turnaround. ￼ ￼

⸻

🏦 Asset Plays
